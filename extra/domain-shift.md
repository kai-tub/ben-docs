# Domain shift

Different ground conditions strongly affect the spectral responses of the samples belonging to the same LULC class because of physical factors (e.g., soil moisture, vegetation) and atmospheric conditions in remote sensing (RS). Thus, in geographically different areas, one observes different spectral behavior associated with samples with the same LULC class label.

The main reasons for the changes in data distributions are as follows:
- The different acquisition conditions (i.e., illumination, atmosphere, look/view angles, sensor parameters) affect the radiometry of the scene,
- The phenological state of the vegetation or the differences in the soil moisture can lead to crucial variations in the spectral response of the same land-cover classes (e.g., bare soil, crops).

Although most of the approaches are effective at a local level, they do not offer robust solutions at a large scale. This is due to the high spatial variability of the spectral signatures of classes (different geographical areas present different spectral behavior for the same land-cover classes because of physical factors [e.g., soil moisture, vegetation], and atmospheric conditions).
This issue is critical at an operational level when the goal is to generate/update land-cover maps and analyze scenes at country, continental or global scales
