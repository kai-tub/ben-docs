    "## mAP for Evaluation of Multi-Label Classification\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Thank you Tom for writing this section!\n",

    "A common way of summarizing evaluation performance in terms of Precision and Recall within a single term is the F1 score. The F1 score can be interpreted as a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, where an F1 score of 1 is related to optimal performance and a F1 score of 0 to worst performance, respectively. The relative contribution of Precision and Recall to the F1 score are equal. If multiple classes are considered (e.g., in Multi-Class Classification tasks like [CIFAR-10/100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/)) the F1 score is usually either evaluated class-based or globally, considered as macro or micro averaging (further reading on macro and micro averaging can be seen in [this micro/macro tutorial on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/micro-macro-weighted-averages-of-f1-score-clearly-explained-b603420b292f)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when evaluating models that were trained on a Multi-Label Classification task like [BigEarthNet](https://bigearth.net/) or the multi-label version of the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), these evaluation procedures are adopted. However, due to the requirement of being able to predict multiple classes at once, the softmax function that is applied in classification tasks with a single label such as Binary Classfication or Multi-Class Classification serving as a probabilty normalizer, has to be exchanged by a sigmoid function that enables multiple (positive) predictions at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of the sigmoid function is that the final predictions per class become disentangled. It may happen that the optimal decision boundary for some classes fall below 0.5. A consequence is that the F1 score (as well as Precision and Recall) that rely on a fixed prediction threshold falsely indicate bad performance for that class, while the inherent predictive power for that class is good, but just at a different scale. A solution to overcome the artefact of class-wise disentangled probabilities provides the metric [(mean) Average Precision](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html). It refers to the area under the [Precision-Recall curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#in-multi-label-settings) and is a more holistic approach for describing predictive power as it does not depend on a probability threshold. Likewise, as other metrics, the mAP metric can be either computed by micro or macro averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many multi-label scenarios, F1 score and mAP will highly correlate. But there exist scenarios in which the F1 score looses its descriptivity for predictive power due to scaling problems (e.g., under some type of multi-label noise), whereas the mAP score maintains its descriptivity. An example can be found below in the [example section](f1_fail). Therefore, it is recommended to always report both F1 score and mAP under micro and macro averaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "SciKit-Learn provides a predefined function [average_prevision_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html) to calculate the AP and/or mAP.\n",
    "By setting `average=None` the AP is calculated for each class and can be used in the multi-label classification scenario to better understand what class might be misbehaving.\n",
    "The mAP is then defined by the specific averaging procedure (`macro`, `micro`, `samples`).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important}\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not forget to mention what averaging procedure was used!\n",
    "Otherwise the reported metric has no value, as there is no way of knowing what the metric is _measuring_.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "It is not uncommon that the optimal decision boundary of a multi-label classification model is _not_ 0.5 for all classes.\n",
    "Metrics that rely on a fixed prediction threshold (Precision/Recall/F1) may report bad performance, even though the model can predict the class, just not at the threshold of 0.5.\n",
    "AP/mAP do not rely on any threshold and give _robust_ estimates of the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "When reporting the mAP the averaging procedure has to be included."
