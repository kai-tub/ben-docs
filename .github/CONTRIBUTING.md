# Contributing to the BigEarthNet Documentation library
This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute!

If you are interested in contributing, there are many ways to help out:
1. It would help us very much if you could
   - Report issues you're facing
   - Give a :+1: on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you
   - Spread the word about the project or simply :star: to say "I use it!"
1. You would like to improve the documentation. Improving the documentation is no less important than improving the library itself!
If you find a typo in the documentation, do not hesitate to submit a GitHub pull request.
1. You would like to propose a new feature and implement it
   - Open an issue and tell us about your goal and a rough sketch on how you would like to implement it. Once we agree that the plan looks good, feel free to start working on your first *pull request*.

## PR guide
1. Install the development dependencies via `pdm install`
1. Update the code/tests
1. Run all tests via `pytest tests/` or `pdm run test`

If anything is unclear, feel free to start the PR and mention the part that is hard to understand. I am happy to help. :)

If everything is OK, and all the tests are passing for the PR, your contribution will be merged.

If you are not familiar with creating a Pull Request, here are some guides:
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14680711/how-to-do-a-github-pull-request
- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Afterwards, you will be added to the list of contributors.

Thanks for your hard work and for sticking around until
the end of the guide! :tada::tada::tada:
